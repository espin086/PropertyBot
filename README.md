#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to produce a set of tools to automate the due diligence portion of real estate analysis. The main objectives are quick analysis of metropolitan areas & properties for sale. 

### Statistical Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling


### Technologies
* Python 
* Google Cloud
* Jupyter

## Project Description

**Hypotheses**
1. A combination of Census data & Historical Listings can inform investment strategy & tactics
2. Profitable investments can be identified automatically using investor criteria (e.g., IRR, NPV, etc.)

**Data Sources**
1. Listing data comes from Redfin.com & Zillow.com
2. Syndication data comes from Crowdstreet.com
3. Census data comes from the American Community Survey

**Analysis Framework**
1. Identify desirable metropolitan areas by population growth, income growth, demographics, etc.
2. Analyze hundreds of properties at scale: expected rents, model expenses, and arrive at profitability. 
3. Create a Web Based tool to scale this analysis to investors across the United States.  

**Blockers**
1. Refactoring code to make it Flask/Web Page ready
2. Automate the collection of data via APIs as opposed to manual downloads.
3. Collect image data from property listings and classify them using Google Vision API.
